<p>an element can easily be 'hidden' from the output</p>

<p id="do-not-show">let us hide this part altogether</p>

<p>
    in that case it won't show up at all, as if it were not in the DOM at all -
    although it is present, can be easily retrieved and turned back on, using
    e.g. JavaScript
</p>

<style>
    #do-not-show {
        display: none;
        background-color: red;
    }
</style>
